# Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with OpenAI

This section explores how to use reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to improve model performance on specific tasks. The [Reinforcement Fine-Tuning notebook](Reinforcement_Fine_Tuning.ipynb) walks through a complete example of:

- Setting up and benchmarking a base model
- Designing effective model graders
- Training with RFT
- Evaluating the fine-tuned model's performance

The example focuses on medical outcome prediction, demonstrating how RFT can help models make more precise and reliable decisions in specialized domains.
